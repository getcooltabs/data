Ryan Graves is a former pilot who flew the F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet. In 2014, he and his colleagues regularly encountered unidentified aerospace phenomena (UAP) off the coast of Virginia Beach. These sightings were so frequent that they had to cancel training missions. By 2021, there have been 11 documented near misses with UAP. The MERGED Podcast is here to explore this phenomenon and the efforts to understand it through the perspective of pilots, scientists, and innovators.

As a Christian with a varied and unique history in ministry and law enforcement, he also brings these life experiences to the table. It is not the purpose of this podcast to present \"the\" way to do anything but rather to use simple logic and experience to try and help others who might be looking for answers.
